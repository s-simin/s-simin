## Welcome to Si Min's GitHub! 

With over 15 years of diverse experience spanning research, teaching, administration, education, and business management, I have cultivated a broad and dynamic skill set. <br><br>
My journey has been fueled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, a passion for learning, and a commitment to constant self-improvement. <br>
I have recently completed the Data Science Immersive at General Assembly Singapore. Armed with new tech skills, I endeavour to use them to empower others to lead better, more joyful lives.
